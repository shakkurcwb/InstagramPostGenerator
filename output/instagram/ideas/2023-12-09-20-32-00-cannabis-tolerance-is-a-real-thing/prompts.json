The primary reason is the desensitization of cannabinoid receptors in the brain. These receptors become less responsive to the cannabinoids found in cannabis, such as THC. Additionally, the body's metabolism may change, leading to faster elimination of cannabinoids. This combination of factors contributes to the development of tolerance.\",\n            \"footer\": \"Reference: Volkow, N. D., & Swanson, J. M. (2020). Evolving Views on Cannabis Legalization.

By switching between different strains, each with its unique cannabinoid profile, individuals can prevent their tolerance from building up to a single strain. This approach allows for a more balanced and consistent cannabis experience, as different strains may have varying levels of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds.\",\n            \"footer\": \"Reference: Russo, E.
